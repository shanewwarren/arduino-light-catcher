# arduino-light-catcher

A very simple game made with the Arduino microcontroller.  

## Setup Instructions

arduino-light-catcher depends on the library [Bounce](http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Code/Bounce).  

Put the Bounce folder in "your Arduino Sketchbook Location/libraries/". To identify this location open "menubar->File->Preferences" within the Arduino IDE.

## How to play

Seven LEDs light up sequentially.  Each time the user is able to press the push-button the moment the middle (4th) LED is lit up the round is won.  With each win, the speed of lights gradually increases.  After the user beats the final round the game resets.
